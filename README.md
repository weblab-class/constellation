## about

Constellation is an interactive course explorer, allowing users to visualize the wealth of classes at MIT, and their interdependencies, in a visually appealing and intuitive manner.

## acknowledgments

Constellation was built by Ezra Erives, Benjamin Wu, and Nicole Wong (MIT â€˜24) as part of the web.lab web programming and development competition.

Constellation was made possible by several libraries, including React-autosuggest.js, vis.js, and the FireRoad API, as well as the support and feedback of the web.lab staff.

## features

Constellation allows users to construct directed networks visualizing course dependencies (read: prerequisites, corequisites, etc) and connections present in the MIT course catalog. Information provided includes:

- Suggested classes, including:
  - Prerequisites
  - Corequisites
  - Subjects that follow a prerequisite or corequisite
  - Related classes
- Class relationships, indicated through directed edges, including: 
  - Arrows to indicate prerequisite information
  - Diamonds to indicate corequisite information

Constellation supports:

- Adding and removing classes
- Saving, loading, resetting and creating new networks
- Dynamic filtering for class attributes such as course and suggestion status

  - FireRoad API (for course data)
  - React-autosuggest.js
  - vis.js

Constellation also uses:
- *Frontend*: Javascript, React, CSS
- *Backend*: Javascript, Mongoose, MongoDB, Python notebook (data processing)
